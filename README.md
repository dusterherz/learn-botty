## What I'm made of

My mother used recast.ai and the microsoft Bot Framework to construct me. All started with [this git](https://github.com/RecastAI/starter-bot-microsoft-connector) !

## What can I do

For the moment, I can say Hello and ask what you want in French (My mother is French :) ), but I can't help her. She is working on it and she got a lot of idea !

## What I will do (maybe, one day ...)

### Weather

* Give you the current Weather
* Give you the weather of Tommorow or of the week
* Say if you need a umbrella, a scarf or a sweater

### Traffic

* Give you the current traffic for your working travel
* Give you the traffic for another address

### Outfit

* Advise your Outfit depending of the weather and of the rendez-vous you have that day

### Agenda

* Can remember for you repetitive tasks like change your cat's litter or to do the laundry or a simple task.
* Can remember a simple rendez-vous like see the doctor at 16:00 in 3 days
* Link it with Wunderlist and Google agenda if possible

### Lifestyle

* Can remember to make you drink water
* Can remember your contaceptive (My mother doesn't want another baby than me and her cat !)

### Budget

* Can make a budget for something like videogames (My mother loves videogames !)
* Can scan a ticket and add something to this budget
